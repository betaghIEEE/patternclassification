\section{Introduction}
Such a library is an addition to the DCG Mathematics framework based information theory to determine structure of a distribution.  One of the strengths of negentroy is that is fair measure of a distribution, and may be used to determine if a distribution is Gaussian.  This library is designed to be used with the DCG Matrix framework.    

In the documentation of ICA, an approximation is typically good enough.  However, it does point out that a full version based on the sample Gaussian.  This involve use of the DCG Gaussian Framework to acquire the entropy of the Gaussian.
