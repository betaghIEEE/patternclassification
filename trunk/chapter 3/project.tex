See how the classification is done different for these types of separation.  

plot of probability important - minimum we get the boundary

normal populations with equal variance covariance matrices

poole method  (combination method)

which case is the bayes discrimant quadratic -  if you have an x^2 term, then that is the case (and is the shape) due to the distribution.  

Use the gradient to simplify the boundary computation.  

Watch out for the three cases of the normal populations.  

Take 3 features at a time and see the misclassification factor.
