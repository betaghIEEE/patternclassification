\section{Whitening Transform}
Watch out for the PCA types (review data on PCA).  Many PCA are treated as the same, as they produce the same general results.  

How do we get ``The following whitening transform (A5 to A6)''.  Show derivation of A6.  

In practice, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ and $\vec{\mu}$ are unknowns for most Gaussian Distributions.  Estimation of this shall come in chapter 3.
